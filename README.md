# WWDC-2018-Colorless

This is my scholarship submission for WWDC 2018, I decided to make a playground about colour-blindness and how people with this condition ses the world.

To do so, I have used the CoreImage library to process the image 7 times for each type of colour-blindness.

P.S. Must be executed using an iPad.

Enjoy!
