# WWDC-2018-Colorless



This is my scholarship submission for WWDC 2018, I decided to make a playground about colour-blindness and how people with this condition ses the world.
n\
To do so, I have used the CoreImage library to process the image 7 times for each type of colour-blindness.

Must be executed using an iPad.
Enjoy!
